**Pi-Bot** serves a multi-functional bot for the Science Olympiad community and more specifically, Scioly.org.

Currently, he is able to interact with many areas on the site, including:
* Forums
* Wiki

The aim of the bot is to assist Science Olympiad members, coaches, tournament staff, and Scioly.org contributors in moving information between various platforms and allowing that information transfer to be less human-intensive.
